        <p class="about-me-paragraph">Hello, thank you for visiting my website. My name is Faye which is short for Fahimeh. Gardening is my passion of over 40 years. I come from a family who gardens and a culture that has many proverbs and sayings that describe the importance of keeping a healthy happy garden at home. Even the etymology of the word "paradise" can be traced back to the old persian word for a beautiful garden, pairi-daeza. 
        </p>
      
        <p class="about-me-paragraph">Here at my house, I planted my first trees back in 1996. These days I enjoy the ease of picking organic fruit straight from the trees I planted years ago. While the best time to plant a tree was yesterday, the next best time is right now. I would like to help anyone with a curiosity of planting or a desire to eat healthy organic food to take advantage of the gifts of mother nature. Texas has wonderful weather for planting many types of fruits and vegetables and best of all, when it comes time to eat your harvest, its free. </p>
      
        <p class="about-me-paragraph">I grow many types of trees including orange, apple, banana, fig, japanese plum, avocado, almond, lemon, sweet lemon and many more. If i'm not at the farmers market or watching youtube videos about growing, chances are I'm in the backyard planting next seasons batch. My goal is to spread as much green as I can while helping people better their health and the enviornment</p>
      
        <p class="about-me-paragraph">Aside from growing trees I also raise organic free range chickens/eggs. They help fertilize my greenhouse with nutritious soil and they love to run around and play in the large green space. I specialize in grafting (the process of combining two or more trees into one). Yes that's right, you can have an apple tree with red and green apples. Or a lemon lime tree. Many things you wouldn't imagine could happen are possible. We have multiple compost bins where we recycle food scraps, and other biodegradables into nutrition dense organic soil. We even collect rainwater to feed our plants.</p>
      
        <p class="about-me-paragraph">If you would like to pick up a tree, learn something particular or just tour the garden feel free to give us a call. I am always happy to have a visitor. If I don't pick up I'm probably planting something. Just leave me a message and I'll do my best to return your call as soon as possible. Thanks for reading, hope to hear from you soon!!!</p>
